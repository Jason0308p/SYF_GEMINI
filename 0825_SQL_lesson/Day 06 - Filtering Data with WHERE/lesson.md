# Day 6: Filtering Data with WHERE

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

## The WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements, etc. to specify a condition.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Operators in The WHERE Clause

The following operators can be used in the `WHERE` clause:

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| = | Equal |
| <> or != | Not equal |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal |
| <= | Less than or equal |
| BETWEEN | Between a certain range |
| LIKE | Search for a pattern |
| IN | To specify multiple possible values for a column |
