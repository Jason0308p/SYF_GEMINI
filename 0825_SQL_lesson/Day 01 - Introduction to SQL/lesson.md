# Day 1: Introduction to SQL and Databases

Welcome to your first day of learning SQL! Today, we'll cover the basics of what SQL and databases are.

## What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of data. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet. You can store, organize, and retrieve information efficiently.

There are two main types of databases:

*   **Relational Databases (SQL):** These databases store data in tables with rows and columns. The relationships between the tables are defined, which is why they are called "relational". Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server.
*   **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** These databases store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They are more flexible than relational databases. Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra.

In this course, we will be focusing on **Relational Databases** and the language used to interact with them: **SQL**.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. You use SQL to perform tasks such as:

*   Retrieving data from a database
*   Inserting new data into a database
*   Updating existing data in a database
*   Deleting data from a database

SQL is a powerful and in-demand skill for anyone working with data.

## Key Concepts

*   **Table:** A collection of related data held in a table format within a database. It consists of columns and rows.
*   **Column:** A vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
*   **Row:** A horizontal entity in a table.
*   **Query:** A request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables.
