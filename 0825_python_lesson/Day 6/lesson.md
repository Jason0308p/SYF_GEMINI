# Day 6: Introduction to Data Pipelines & Orchestration

Today, we will learn about data pipelines and the tools used to orchestrate them.

## What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a series of automated data processing steps. It is a more general term than ETL, as it can include any sequence of data processing, such as data validation, cleaning, enrichment, and modeling.

## What is Data Orchestration?

Data orchestration is the process of automating the execution of data pipelines. It involves scheduling, managing dependencies, and monitoring the execution of the pipelines.

## Why is Data Orchestration Important?

As data pipelines become more complex, it becomes difficult to manage them manually. Data orchestration tools help to:

*   **Schedule pipelines to run at specific times or intervals.**
*   **Manage dependencies between tasks.** For example, a task that loads data into a data warehouse should not run until the task that extracts the data has completed successfully.
*   **Monitor the execution of pipelines and alert you to any failures.**
*   **Retry failed tasks automatically.**

## Data Orchestration Tools

There are many data orchestration tools available, both open-source and commercial.

### Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is one of the most popular open-source data orchestration tools. It allows you to define your data pipelines as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** of tasks.

Key features of Airflow include:

*   **Dynamic pipeline generation:** Pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic generation of pipelines.
*   **Extensible:** You can create your own custom operators and executors.
*   **Scalable:** Airflow has a modular architecture and can be scaled to handle a large number of pipelines.
*   **Rich UI:** Airflow provides a web-based UI for monitoring and managing your pipelines.
