# Day 1: Introduction to Data Engineering & Python for Data Manipulation

Welcome to your first day of learning data engineering! Today, we'll cover the basics of what a data engineer does and how to use the Python library Pandas to manipulate data.

## What is a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is a professional who prepares data for analytical or operational uses. They are responsible for building and maintaining the data infrastructure and pipelines that collect, store, and process data.

Key responsibilities include:

*   **Data Pipelines (ETL/ELT):** Building pipelines to Extract data from various sources, Transform it into a usable format, and Load it into a data warehouse or other storage system.
*   **Data Modeling:** Designing the structure of the database or data warehouse.
*   **Data Quality:** Ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.

## Python and Pandas

Python is the most popular language for data engineering due to its extensive libraries and frameworks. **Pandas** is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.

### Key Pandas Concepts

*   **DataFrame:** A 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
*   **Series:** A 1-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.

Today, we will learn how to read data from a CSV file, clean it up, and write it to a new CSV file using Pandas.
